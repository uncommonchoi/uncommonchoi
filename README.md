# Iron Fist Alexander

### I am the great jar warrior, Iron Fist Alexander! Lend me strength, O warriors within! Let us become one champion, together!

> *"As I suspected... Victory... was impossible. This vessel... was found lacking..."*

> *"My thanks, I knew you were the stuff of champions. It was a marvelous battle."*

> *"I implore you, take what I bequeath... from inside me... All vessels are destined to one day break."*

> *"But the great Alexander lived as a warrior to his last! Ha ha ha ha!"*
